# HelloWorld
This is my 1st github repo/project. Hoping to learn more and more as the time goes by.
I'm presently active within the manufacturing workspace, delivering on targets and ensuring no downtime, lol.
I also enjoy meeting new people and making new friends.
but most importantly, I love to succeed at whatever I do. IT hardware, networking and now software development.
I believe the world is gradually moving away from the traditional way of working. Soon, machines will replace humans in virtually every sphere of their endeavors.
As scary as this might sound to many, I believe it's the way to go, in order for mankind to release itself of the shackles around their minds. 
In oder to grow, we must not limit ourselves to the confines of the past as development will continue to overcome present obstacles and limitations.
